            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>As the year is coming to an end, I'm starting to think of all of the goals and milestones I set for myself at the beginnning of the year. Since it is the fourth quarter of the year, it's the perfect time to put my foot on the pedal and work on achieving the goals I've not yet accomplished. <strong>Tis the Season to make moves.</strong></p><p>Like most people, one of the goals I set for myself was a fitness goal. I'm in fairly decent shape already but I know for a fact that I could be in much better shape. In complete honesty, I haven't been actively working on this goal throughout the year. I am a member of a gym, but like most people I have a membership but don't use it as often as I'd like. Looking back at it time just got away from me. My goal is to get down to 175-180lbs. At the beginning of the year, I was around 205-210lbs. Currently I am 193-195lbs. In order for me to reach my goal, I need to lose around 15-20lbs in 3 months which is an attainable goal. The plan is to crack down on my diet (Zaxby's is my guilty pleasure) and place myself on a strict workout plan with a focus on cardio and toning. Luckily I have epxerience with creating workout plans, so it won't be difficult brainstorming ideas. All of my workouts, meals, stats, and progress pics will be post on this site so stay tuned and feel free to contact me with any questions or request!</p><p>Another goal i had at the beginning of the year was to start my public speaking career. Over the past 6 years, I've developed a fascination for speaking in public. While in college I participated in my universities <a href="https://www.toastmasters.com">Toastmasters</a> club, learning and honing in on my public speaking and leadership skills. I learned sooooo much during my collegiate years, but I did not continue to work on the craft once I graduated. The goal for the nexxt 3 months is to find a Toastmasters club in my area and get back to honing in on my public speaking skills. My ultimate goal is to produce motivational content and speak aorund the nation on the topics of achieving goals, career advancement, and self-care. Tis' the season to practice my skills and begin producing content. Of course, everything will be posted to this site so stay tuned!&nbsp;</p><p>My last goal was focused on my personal project, OneFit! There is an entire <a href="projects.html">page</a> and blog <a href="laying-the-foundation.html">post</a> on this project so I'll keep this paragraph brief. The idea for OneFit is sort of a branch off of CollegeFit (that's why the names are similar), Since I had graduated and I wasn't living the college lifestyle anymore, I begin to think about different things I could build in order to help a market or a group of people looking to make a living practicing and perfecting their craft. Since I had experience with personal training, creating an app to help trainers engage with their clients was the perfect idea to me. I'll be continually postng development updates on this site so feel free to keep up with development and ask any question you may have. Also feel free to comment!&nbsp;</p><p>it's the 4th Quarter and I am going to make this a very productive and successful quarter. Big things are on the horizon and I'm excited to share these moments and successes with all of you!&nbsp;</p></div>
